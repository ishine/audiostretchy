# AudioStretchy Documentation

**AudioStretchy is a Python library and command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for high-quality time-stretching of audio files without altering their pitch.**

It leverages David Bryant's robust [audio-stretch C library](https://github.com/dbry/audio-stretch), which implements the Time-Domain Harmonic Scaling (TDHS) algorithm, particularly effective for speech. For versatile audio file handling (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, etc.) and resampling, AudioStretchy integrates [Spotify's Pedalboard library](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard).

## TL;DR

AudioStretchy provides high-quality audio time-stretching without pitch changes using the TDHS algorithm. Install with `pip install audiostretchy`, then use via CLI or Python API to stretch audio files while preserving natural sound quality.

## Quick Example

=== "Command Line"

    ```bash
    # Make audio 20% slower
    audiostretchy input.mp3 output.wav --ratio 1.2
    
    # Make audio 25% faster with custom parameters
    audiostretchy speech.wav faster.wav --ratio 0.75 --upper_freq 300
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from audiostretchy.stretch import stretch_audio
    
    # Simple stretching
    stretch_audio("input.mp3", "output.wav", ratio=1.2)
    
    # Advanced usage with class
    from audiostretchy.stretch import AudioStretch
    
    processor = AudioStretch()
    processor.open("input.flac")
    processor.stretch(ratio=0.8, upper_freq=350)
    processor.resample(target_framerate=48000)
    processor.save("output.wav")
    ```

## What Makes AudioStretchy Special?

Unlike simple playback speed changes that also alter pitch, AudioStretchy uses sophisticated algorithms to:

- **Preserve pitch** while changing duration
- **Maintain audio quality** through advanced signal processing
- **Handle various audio types** from speech to music
- **Provide fine control** over the stretching process
